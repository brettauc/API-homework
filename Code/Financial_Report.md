### Budget Analysis
Based on the budget analysis, Harold's customer has consistent monthly expenses of $10,645.24 which is being driven by the customer's transfer category spend. This is shown by the charts below (noting that April (4) and July (7) are expenses for only half of the month).

The spend in the transfer category is made up of $5,850 per month to Gusto(a company that provides a cloud-based payroll, benefits, and human resource management software for businesses) and a $1,000 deposit into a CD.

The current income data that was provided shows the customer only having $500 of monthly income. Being that the customer is paying Gusto each month it is save to assume that the customer owns a business.  I would need the income data from the business to provide a full budget analysis.

### Retirement Planning
After running 500 simulations over a 30 year period for a portfolio made up of 60% stocks and 40% bonds with an initial investment of $20k the customer could expect returns between $2.4 million and $6.4 million. if the customer would increase their initial investment by 50% to $30k the customer could expect returns between $3.6 million and $9.6 million.

Based on the Monte Carlo simulations and the distribution bar graph below it is more likely for the portfolio to be between $2.4 million(10th percentile) and $4 million(50th percentile) with an inital investment of $20k.  If the customer started with an initial investment of $30k it is more likely for the expected returns to be between $3.6 million and $6 million.  This assumption is made due to the probability distribution bell curve being closer to the 10 percentile line.

Based on this information, if the customer wanted to take a 4% retirement withdrawal he/she could expect a yearly income of $96k with an initial investment of $30k and $144k with an initial investment of $30k.

In conclusion, I would not be able to provide a recommendation to the customer because I only have data showing a yearly income of $7389 from the budget analysis.
